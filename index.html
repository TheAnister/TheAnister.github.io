  <b>Latest Updates:</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    2.3beta (11/08/2022): Now used GUI to create a screenshot of the webpage, and fixed a major 2.2 bug.
    <br>
    <br>
  2.2 (10/08/2022): Now stores the settings files in your local AppData folder, so different users can't get their settings mixed up. It also greets you using your name at the start :)
  <br>
  <br>
  2.1 + 2.1exe (07/08/2022): Now, it includes a default settings file if you would like to automatically re-create the website before you visit it.
  <br>
  <br>
  2.0exe (03/08/2022): After weeks of trying, we have finally converted 2.0 into an exe file.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>GITHUB RELEASE (28/07/2022)</b>: We have now <a href="https://github.com/TheAnister/webpage-viewer">released on github!</a> Anyone is free to change the latest-version file, or you can browse releases or even install our program using 'git' in command-based programs!
  <br>
  <br>
  2.0 (28/07/2022): Now you have an option to either to type the input into a GUI or use the console. It stores these settings into a file, so it's quicker.
  <br>
  <br>
  2.0beta (26/07/2022): Can now create a preview of the website using text, however is quite buggy and times out before all text can be printed.
  <br>
  <br>
  1.5 (26/07/2022): Fixed major 1.4 bugs and added search history (type in 'searchHistory' or 'search history' to view it)
  <br>
  <br>
  1.4 (20/07/2022): Added a website prefix of 'www' and also tells you your default search engine at the start
  <br>
  <br>
  1.2exe (20/07/2022): We have now officially created the first .exe file that you can use instead of manually running the file! We are working on creating a 1.3exe
  <br>
  <br>
  1.3 (20/07/2022): Officially fixed the bugs of 1.3beta. It can now accurately store your data in a secure place that doesn't require admin, it can install modules by itself, and when you type 'https' at the start it registers it as a website, otherwise if you don't it registers it as a search query, and then opens it using your prefered search engine.
  <br>
  <br>
  1.3beta: Totally revamped the project: Now, it asks you for a default search engine at the start and stores that data to your files(currently very buggy, run program as admin), and the search engine feature and website feature are integrated(https:// for a website, or anything else for a normal search). We have also added in a feature that automatically installs the required modules, making it easier for you to start the pogram without any hassle. As the features implemented are still buggy, it is NOT recommended to use this version yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  1.2: Added in different search engines (nine to be exact!) and auto-restart feature.
  <br>
  <br>
  1.1: Added in a search query.
  <br>
  <br>
  1.0: Added in an offline version where you can save the webpage
